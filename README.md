# MapleFrenzy

A trade execution platform that links buyers and sellers in the Maplestory gaming community.

This website allows sellers to post listings for their service at a specific date, to which buyers can locate them and join their service with their in-game username, server, and for how long they will be purchasing the service for.

The seller dashboard allows sellers to efficiently keep track of the buyers that purchased their service, and how many times their service has been executed.
